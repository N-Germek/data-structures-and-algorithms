# Sorting Comparisons

## Author: Natalija Germek Clarke

Write functions or methods which sort domain objects. The functions/methods will receive an array of Movie objects.
Each Movie object has a title (string), a year (number), and a list of genres (array of strings). One function/method
will sort the movies by most recent year first. One function will sort the movies, alphabetical by title, but will
ignore any leading “A”s, “An”s, or “The”s. An array of sample data is included in the source code. Tests are located in
the testing folder in sorting directiry.

After writing code for the sorting method, you will write tests for your comparator functions/methods. Refactoring may
be necessary. Tests will need to call comparator functions/methods directly and make assertions about the response values
when given test inputs.
