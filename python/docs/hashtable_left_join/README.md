# Hashmap LEFT JOIN

The process of checking the left (or first) hashmap against the right (or second) one and returning all values in the
left hashmap and anything requested out of the right is left join logic. Once the data is joined into one data structure
it is officially a left joined algorithm.

## Challenge

Write a function that takes in the arguments of two hashmaps and joins it into a single data structure.

- Left Hashmap has word strings as keys and synonym as values.
- Right Hashmap has word string as keys and antonyms of the keys as values

Return the data structure with the left join logic in the new data structure.

If no value exists in the right hashmap, then return a variation of None in the appended  results row of the list.
