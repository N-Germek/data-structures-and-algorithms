# Challenge Summary
Create a class called AnimalShelter which holds only dogs and cats. The shelter operates using a first-in, first-out approach and implements the following methods:
enqueue() - this passes the animal argument in which case animal can either be cat or dog.
dequeue() - this passes the pref argument in which pref can either be dog or cat, then will return a dog or cat based on preference. If the preference is not a dog or a cat, it will return None.

Still a work in progress as code is not functioning.
